# Sort Visualizer
This is a simple app built to enable the visualization of different (in-place) sorting algorithms. The app can generate up to 500 randomized columns. The user can then
select a delay so the steps of the sort can be seen, select which sort algorithm to use, and then run the sort. Each column is defaulted to a cyan color, when it is being
compared to another column it is red, and when it is in the correct place it is green. The app also keeps track of the number of comparisons and swaps the algorithms use
so its efficiency can be easily compared to the other algorithms.
